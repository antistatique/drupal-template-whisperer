It is a continuation to something besides the standard
node.html.twig file for a variety of special case pages
like site news lists, contact page, ...

## You need Template Whisperer if

  - You want to generate a specific template of a node
    E.g. `node--article--xyz.html.twig`.
  - You want to allow the editors to freely include pre-defined content on the
    node by themselves.
    E.g. Add a list of the three latest news at the end of the content.
  - You don't want to hardcode node ID for specific templating but want the content to drive this decision.
  - You don't want to hardcode/configure node url to render blocks (default behavior of Drupal Layout) in a custom template (may need (Bambo Twig)[https://www.drupal.org/project/bamboo_twig]).
  - You want Pathauto be able to detect which page list your specific content to generate a real dynamic pattern driven by content creation.
  Eg. node of type article need a Pathauto patterns `/articles/article/[node:title]`, you can then use `[suggestion:lookup:articles_collection:entity:url:path]/[node:title]`.

Template Whisperer can do a lot more than that,
but those are some of the obvious uses of Template Whisperer.

## Features

* An administration interface to manage Template Whisperer.

* Use of standard fields for entity support, allowing for translation and
  revisioning of Template Whisperer values added for individual entities.

* Fully Token integration.
 - Highly versatile URLs patterns with Template Whisperer Tokens in Pathauto.

* High permissions granularity:
  - `administer template whisperer suggestion entities`: Access the administration forms for CRUD operations on Suggestion(s).
  - `administer the template whisperer field`: Allow to see & edit any Template Whisperer field(s).

## Standard usage scenario

1. Install the module.
2. Open admin/structure/template-whisperer.
3. Create your own suggestion by clicking "Add Template Whisperer.
4. Attach a new field "Template Whisperer" for a specific entity.

  4.1 Go to the "Manage fields" of the bundle where
  the Template Whisperer field should appear.
  4.2 Select "Template Whisperer" from the "Add a new field" selector.
  4.3 Fill in a label for the field, e.g. "Template Whisperer",
  and set an appropriate, machine name, e.g. "template_whisperer".
  4.4 Click "Save and continue".
  4.5 If the site supports multiple languages, and translations have been
  enabled for this entity, you can select "Users may translate this field" to
  use Drupal's translation system.

5. When you edit the content of that entity or
  bundle you should then see the new "Template Whisperer"
  section on the Advanced tabs.')

  5.1 Select the template you want to use for that entity or bundle
  5.2 You can now edit your template which is formatted this way:
  `[entity-type-id]--[entity-type]--list-news.html.twig`.
